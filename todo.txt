Only the goroutine that is writing to a channel should be the one to close it.
Need to change the code so that toCl is closed by the routine function and not in DeleteTransaction().

can't just change it so that it is closed in comeOnline or the master routine because we are also writing error messages to it in the client Route function
maybe could make a global stream or something idk
or have multiple channels for each goroutine that writes to it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19992334/how-to-listen-to-n-channels-dynamic-select-statement
